Honestly I think we are all looking at this the wrong way. In the not so distant past we saw the actual debts left by our previous government. We also as citizens should take into account whilst we are pressuring  our new government to action their manifesto and technically they should what we should put into perspective is time. The previous government wouldn't or didn't provide information so clearly or honestly to the rakyat and when polling came the new government was shocked and blindsighted when they  took over. Don't be fooled Malaysia is heavily in debt and the new government must give some and must get some. As rakyats we should try and put things into perspective and take a step back and give our new government some time to correct the previous government's fumbles. Each time we read something that PH is trying to do we are quick to be judgemental and start accusing or criticising the new government. A lot of t processes needed to be put in place logically takes time. Simply threatening to change the government each time a proposal comes out is rather childish don't you think? We are paying indirect tax for almost everything. Example,positive

Where does this money go? Malaysian airport immigration customer service is very poor due to no professional training given to them. If they are trained they bring people from worse customer service countries to train them. So how can things be improved if money is not used properly? I'm sure many won't complain paying this if the level of of service is let's say same as Australia this includes the big welcoming smiles and how are you today? Questions we get. I wouldn't mind paying even a bit more if this can be improved. If training is done pls get world class training by top western countries not other Asian Arab or Eastern European countries. ??,neutral
Why are you taxing us left right and centre? Use other ways to collect more money. Not from malaysians. We have suffered enough.,negative
Why don??t they just include together with ticket price airport tax etc. how to evade then!?,neutral
Why don??t they make the levy inclusive of the flight ticket? Just so that no one will ??avoid?? or refuse to pay and no one needs to pay any fines or face jail sentence ?,neutral
Why not added in the bus car flight tickets? ????,neutral
Why not make it only those who voted for PH need to pay this new tax... Fair for those who didn't vote them (not voting PH doesn't means they voted for BN),negative
Why put people at risk of forgetting or neglecting to pay he levy? Can't the government work it into the payment system so automatically paid before proceeding departure? Looks like you just want to 'trap' travellers and get more money.,negative
Why suck malaysians for departure? Should tax the foreigners for arrive at Malaysia la,negative
Wish PH all the best in next election,negative

"Wow its so suprising and sad for the Klinik Dental Tanglin to tell me today (10.4.2019)that their Teeth Filling Machine is ""Rosak"" and they dont know when it will be repaired so call them back next week or anytime before walking later to check if its ready as currently they only Extract Teeth and give appointment for Root Canal cases only in the afternoon? What is happening to Government Kliniks in Malaysia now and also to share with you all as I remember thats the same thing the ""UTC Pudu Klinik"" told me last year! So is this the latest way for cutting cost and providing wonderful service to public and by providing to certain group only? Can someone please share with to all and advise how to avoid going about this kind of situation!??????",neutral
Wow. The reaction from everyone is amazing. It's like as though we leave the country on a daily basis and this is worse than toll charges.  There are years where I don't even travel overseas and now because of this tax I should vote in a new government? Talk about being overdramatic.   Wake up guys you want less taxes but a prosperous nation? You need to be prepared to pay for it. PH inherited a nation in massive debt. You think they gonna pull money from the sky to make life easier for you?   The govt. has to be selective in who they tax and how much. You use the highways pay toll you fly pay tax etc. The one where I think they need to work on is paying the toll concessionaires for not raising the toll rates. They use govt. money for that so the fella from Kelantan who never comes to KL and use our highways are paying for the toll we use simply because the govt. doesn't want to overburden us. That is what we should be angry about and don't get me started on Proton and the fines we are paying our neighbours for not honouring AFTA.,positive
